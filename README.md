# PE4
-Antonio Narro and Varunjit Srinivas
Antonio was person1 and Varunjit was person2.
The program creates a 2-d vector of strings that represents the board and then prints the blank board. After creating the board the code then goes into a while loop that counts to 9 turns. The person representing 'X' goes first and the code prompts the user twice to enter where the want to go. The code takes one int value at a time. The first value taken represents the column value and the second value taken represents the row value. The code assumes 0 indexing so 0 represents the beginning row and column and 2 represents the last row and column. The code also assumes that you will not input the same location twice. After 9 turns the program ends.
